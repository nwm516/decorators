# Exploring Decorators in TypeScript

This was an assignment for my Mobile Application Development class. 

Objective: "Understand and implement decorators in TypeScript to modify and enhance class behavior at design time."

To run: Within the project folder, if any alterations are made to the .ts files, you will need to run "npx tsc" in order for the .js files to either be created or updated. "node index.js" will run the program with the compiled output of the various methods.
